### Disclaimer

This plugin does not provide any guarantees of making your website GDPR-compliant. As a website operator, you are always responsible to verify if this plugin works for you and collect consent for external scripts before loading them in the visitor's browser.

### How it works

> **Short**: External files are downloaded to your WordPress installation (into the uploads-folder) and then served from there.

**More details**:

The plugin scans every URL that is enqueued via `wp_enqueue_script()` and `wp_enqueue_style()`. When detecting external URL, that file is saved to your uploads-folder and served from there.

It also scans the contents of CSS files for external dependencies and also saves those files to your uploads-folder!

Heads-up: For technical reasons, we cannot scan the contents of JS files for such dependencies - JS files can always inject external assets

#### No Output Buffer

This plugin does not add any "output buffering" but scans the URLs which are enqueued via recommended WordPress functions.

As a result, *GDPR Cache Scripts & Styles* has practically no performance impact on your response time, no matter how big your website is.

#### Background worker

To speed up your websites loading time, all assets are downloaded in a background process: When a new asset is detected, or a cached file expires, a worker-task is enqueued.

The queue is then processed in an asynchronous process; while the queue is processed, your website could still serve the external assets for a while - usually the queue is processed within one or two minutes.

#### Options page

You'll find the plugin options page at Tools > GDPR Cache. On that page you can invalidate all assets and see a list of the entire cache.

When you deactivate the plugin, the entire cache is purged (all files are deleted and relevant DB values are reset)
